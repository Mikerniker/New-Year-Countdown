# New-Year-Countdown

This is a practice project to countdown to the New Year (2023) using Python, Flask, and some Bootstrap.
This Countdown App was adapted from Tutorial#128 from Codemy and Ardit Sulce's demo of how to use Flask. The original Codemy code was modified by turning the code into a function and to also count down with hours and minutes using a basic conversions. The Flask tutorial from Ardit Sulce was adapted as a guide to navigate through Flask.
