# New-Year-Countdown

This is a practice project to countdown to the New Year (2023), using Python, Flask, and some Bootstrap.
This is a Countdown App that was initially based on Tutorial#128 from Codemy and Ardit Sulce's demo of how to use Flask. The original Codemy code was modified to turn the code into a function and to also count down with hours and minutes with a basic conversion. The original code from Ardit Sulce was also changed in terms of it's overall visual and was mainly used as a guide for navigating through Flask.
